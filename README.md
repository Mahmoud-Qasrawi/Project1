# Parallel Merge Sort using Pthreads

This project implements and benchmarks a parallel version of the Merge Sort algorithm using Pthreads in C++. It compares the performance of sequential vs multithreaded implementations and includes graphs, timing data, and a final report.

 Folder Structure

- `src/` â€” C++ source files for both sequential and parallel implementations.
- `docs/` â€” Final project report and performance graphs.
- `results/` â€” Timing data collected from all experiments.

 Algorithm Overview

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively splits arrays and merges them in sorted order. This project parallelizes the sorting of left and right halves using `pthread_create` and synchronizes them with `pthread_join`.

System Specifications

- **CPU**: Intel Core i3-8130U (2 cores / 4 threads)
- **RAM**: 8 GB
- **OS**: Windows 10 + WSL
- **Compiler**: g++ with `-pthread` flag

Input Sizes Tested

- 1,000
- 10,000
- 100,000
- 1,000,000

Each was tested with:
- 1 thread
- 2 threads
- 4 threads

Performance Graphs

Graphs showing execution time and speedup for different thread counts can be found in `docs/graphs/`.

Report

See `docs/Project1 Report.pdf` for full documentation, analysis, and conclusions.

AI Assistance Disclaimer

Some assistance was provided by OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT for parallel code, graph generation, and documentation editing. All final code and analysis were verified tested  ran and understood and run anby the author.
