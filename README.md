# Parallel Merge Sort using Pthreads

This project implements and benchmarks a parallel version of the Merge Sort algorithm using Pthreads in C++. It compares the performance of sequential vs multithreaded implementations and includes graphs, timing data, and a final report.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `src/` — C++ source files for both sequential and parallel implementations.
- `docs/` — Final project report and performance graphs.
- `results/` — Timing data collected from all experiments.

## 🧠 Algorithm Overview

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively splits arrays and merges them in sorted order. This project parallelizes the sorting of left and right halves using `pthread_create` and synchronizes them with `pthread_join`.

## 🖥️ System Specifications

- **CPU**: Intel Core i3-8130U (2 cores / 4 threads)
- **RAM**: 8 GB
- **OS**: Windows 10 + WSL
- **Compiler**: g++ with `-pthread` flag

## 📊 Input Sizes Tested

- 1,000
- 10,000
- 100,000
- 1,000,000

Each was tested with:
- 1 thread
- 2 threads
- 4 threads

## 📈 Performance Graphs

Graphs showing execution time and speedup for different thread counts can be found in `docs/graphs/`.
